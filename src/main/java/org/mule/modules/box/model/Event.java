/**
 * When something changes in a user’s Box account, either in folders they own or folders they collaborate on, Box logs an 'event' for the user.
 * Box's /events endpoint is focused on delivering to you a low latency, highly reliable list of all the events relevant to your Box account.
 * Events are registered against a time-sequenced list called the streamPosition. When you do a GET against /events API and pass in a streamPosition Box
 * responds to you with the events that happened slightly before that stream position, up to the current streamPosition, or the chunkSize, whichever is lesser.
 * Due to timing lag across Box's multiple datacenters, and our preference of low-latency and insurance to make sure you don’t miss some event,
 * you may receive duplicate events when you call the /events API. You should use the eventId field in each returned event to check for duplicate events
 * and discard ones that you have already processed. You may also receive events that are 'before' events that you’ve already received by roughly 5-15 seconds.
 * This is simply due to the variability in when events get recorded, and Box's preference for delivering events to you as soon as they know about them.
